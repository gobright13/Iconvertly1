Looking at the current PuckEmailEditor implementation, I can see several issues that need to be addressed. Let fix these problems systematically:
1.	Container drag/drop zones - Currently containers don't have proper drop zones
2.	Responsive design - Missing mobile/tablet auto-responsiveness
3.	Enhanced text editing - Need better formatting options
4.	Layout blocks - Grid layouts need proper drop zones
5.	Auto-save functionality - Save drafts automatically
6.	Remove publish button - Focus on email editing only
Let me update the PuckEmailEditor with these improvements:
client/src/components/PuckEmailEditor.tsx
Now let me create a simple "My Emails" library component that will store all the drafts and completed emails:
client/src/components/MyEmailsLibrary.tsx
Now let me update the EmailBuilder component to integrate with the My Emails library:
client/src/components/EmailBuilder.tsx
The email editor has been significantly enhanced with the following improvements:
